GHBNetloadApplet
================


This small piece of software supplies an applet for the gnome desktop. It
displays your current netload in the gnome toolbar.


Compiling / Installing
----------------------

See INSTALL, but it is basically "./configure && make && sudo make install".


Configuring
-----------

GHBNetloadApplet depends on the Api that is made available by the NetAdmins of
the GHB (thanks by the way!). Therefore you have to create (or copy from
/usr/local/share/ghbnetloadapplet/ghbnetloadapplet.sample.xml (usually)) an
xml-file in your home directory called .ghbnetloadapplet.xml, which contains at
least "key", but zero or more of the others: 
<key>: it contains the api-key, which you can request at 
http://ghb.fh-furtwangen.de/api.  
<update>: the amount of seconds which must pass until 
a new request to the servers is made.  
<maxtraffic>: just for reference, you can not change your limit here
;-). It is usually set to 4.7 GB, but you can change it to set your own
personal limit or [insert other use here]


Warning 
-------

This is still beta software, and the following features are not existent for
now:
*	support for multiple hosts, you can only use it if you have just one
	host. Support for this will be added in the near future 

*	forced refresh

*	<add your requested feature here>


I can not give you an assurance that the display is accurate, so don't blame me
if you are over the limit. Please use the interface supplied by the GHB
NetAdmins to check your traffic frequently....

Feedback / bug reports are welcome, please send them to: mail@jonasw.de or talk
